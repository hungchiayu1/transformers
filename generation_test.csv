"Speaker SHELDON: Hi. Hello. 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name. 
Speaker LEONARD: Subtle. 
Speaker SHELDON: But you got it, right? 
Speaker HOWARD: Hey, guys. 
Speaker PENNY: Hey. Hi. Hello. 
Speaker HOWARD: I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ","Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before."
"Speaker RAJ: They're going to digitally add a supernova.
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent. 
Speaker SHELDON: Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. 
Speaker RAJ: Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor. 
Speaker RAJ: Go for Koothrappali. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with wire cutters."
"Speaker RACHEL: I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... And Monica knows… 
Speaker ROSS: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know! 
Speaker MONICA: ","Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
"Speaker LEONARD: Do you think Penny's mad at me? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ",Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.
"Speaker MONICA: Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. 
Speaker MONICA: ",Am I out of control?
"Speaker CHANDLER: What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","You know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular."
"Speaker LEONARD: Yes, I live with him.
I don't... I-I really don't know why. 
Speaker LEONARD: Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye. 
Speaker LEONARD: She wants to have dinner and talk about my research. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?"
"Speaker SHELDON: consider changing disciplines.
Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history. 
Speaker SHELDON: One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don't have to create things. 
Speaker SHELDON: You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. 
Speaker SHELDON: You could have fun with that. 
Speaker LEONARD: Yeah, that's not it. 
Speaker LEONARD: Stuart's kind of interested in Amy. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
"Speaker BERNADETTE: So, what happens next? 
Speaker RAJ: I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Ooh, I'm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
"Speaker PERSON: What are you doing here? 
Speaker SHELDON: Hang on. 130 over 80. It's a little high. 
Speaker SHELDON: We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk. 
Speaker PERSON: Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.
"Speaker LEONARD: Robot girlfriend. 
Speaker HOWARD: Mm, that was mine. 
Speaker LEONARD: Robot prostitute. 
Speaker HOWARD: Also mine. 
Speaker SHELDON: Wait. I'm confused. 
Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute? 
Speaker HOWARD: There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.
Boy, when you met Bernadette, 
Speaker RAJ: ","Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
"Speaker SHELDON: Ugh! It's like walking into the Amazon.
And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping.
The awful one with birds and snakes. 
Speaker AMY: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain. 
Speaker SHELDON: Four keys!
Who does he think he is, a warden? 
Speaker AMY: See? Maybe you'll love living alone. 
Speaker SHELDON: I don't know. Perhaps. 
Speaker AMY: ","And if it turns out you don't... - you and I could live together. - You and... Oh, sure."
"Speaker MONICA: Hey guys, what should I wear to a Nick's game? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",A tshirt that says - I don't belong here.
"Speaker SHELDON: So what'd you think? 
Speaker AMY: It was good. 
Speaker SHELDON: That's it? 
Speaker SHELDON: ""Good""? 
Speaker AMY: ","I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> for the first time."
"Speaker HOWARD: I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. 
Speaker HOWARD: I promised my mother. 
Speaker RAJ: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. 
Speaker RAJ: But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays.
"Speaker ROSS: This would be the place where you explain the hat 
Speaker JOEY: Oh, Okay. This is called the top hat? 
Speaker ROSS: And why are you wearing this? Is it top hat? 
Speaker JOEY: Oh , yeah. There's this play right. And I am up for the part of this real cool like suave, international guy. A real close horse. So I figured everyone in the audition is gonna be wearing this kind of, you now, ultra hip, high fashion stuff. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",And you are gonna make them all disappear.
"Speaker MONICA: Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down. 
Speaker PERSON: Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party. 
Speaker RACHEL: All right, bye-bye. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
"Speaker RACHEL: All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else? 
Speaker ROSS: Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember? 
Speaker RACHEL: Yeah, because I was 
Speaker ROSS: ",You still love me?
"Speaker RACHEL: Did you have fun at the bachelor's party last night? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh yeah, look what I got, she is fully dressed right. And then you click it and oh oh she naked. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","And then and then you clicked it again, she's dressed. She is a business woman, she is walking down the street and oh oh oh she's naked."
"Speaker RAJ: You're all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. 
Speaker RAJ: (electronic sound effects playing) And welcome to 20 years in the future. 
Speaker RAJ: Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Well, my beer isn't flat and my rack's not saggy. So far, the future's great."
"Speaker PERSON: Oh no 
Speaker SHELDON: What? 
Speaker PERSON: ",You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I've never seen anything like it.
"Speaker HOWARD: I promised my mother. 
Speaker RAJ: I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. 
Speaker RAJ: But that's something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturer. 
Speaker SHELDON: Not to mention you'd have to power down on saturdays. 
Speaker LEONARD: Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but Occam's rasor would suggest that someone threw it out."
"Speaker PHOEBE: That's a good one. Mine is to pilot a commercial jet. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","ThatÕs a good one too Pheebs, now all that I have to do is find a plane load of people whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths"
"Speaker RACHEL: May I see your boarding pass? 
Speaker PERSON: Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.

Speaker RACHEL: ","No, I know, but I,he just went on."
"Speaker SHELDON: Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. 
Speaker SHELDON: Amy, you're a neuroscientist.
Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
"Speaker ROSS: Whoa ostralopificus isn't supposed to be in that display. No, no, Homohabilus was erect, Ostralopificus was never fully erect. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Maybe he was nervous.
"Speaker HOWARD: and she makes me Froot Loops. 
Speaker PERSON1: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that. 
Speaker PERSON2: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl. 
Speaker PERSON1: Congratulations. 
Speaker HOWARD: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch. 
Speaker PERSON1: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding? 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind, I'm not really up for chatting. I'm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes."
"Speaker PERSON: Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter? 
Speaker PENNY: In a way. 
Speaker PENNY: We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment. 
Speaker PERSON: Oh. Well, you're lucky. He seems very talented.
And I'm sure a lot of people want to work with him. 
Speaker PENNY: Well, a lot of people can't. 
Speaker PENNY: Uh, hey. 
Speaker LEONARD: Where are we going? 
Speaker PENNY: ",My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
"Speaker BERNADETTE: Can you please just let it go? 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, I can help you with that. 
Speaker SHELDON: Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen. 
Speaker SHELDON: While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket. 
Speaker HOWARD: Hold that thought. 
Speaker HOWARD: Hello? 
Speaker AMY: How can I make this up to you? 
Speaker PENNY: ",The answer's in this puzzle box. Let's see if you can open it.
"Speaker DOROTHY: Just keep thinking about Ma and whose mother she really is. 
Speaker ROSE: You worried she might be Gina's? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ",No I am worried she might be Phir Resuda's
"Speaker BERNADETTE: You heard what he said about his parents. 
It was the little things they kept bottled up. 
I don't want that to happen to us. 
Speaker HOWARD: How can I convince you it won't? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside? 
Speaker HOWARD: I'm not answering that. 
It's a trap. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: So there<i> are</i> things you don't like. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I'm gonna chew my leg off.
"Speaker MODERATOR: Scott scott come back. You have to realize that we are a bunch of people with severe problems. 
Speaker MODERATOR: We have been trying to help ourselves, just like you have been trying to help yourself. 
Speaker MODERATOR: That's why we need to help each other. 
Speaker MODERATOR: I mean, you seem like a decent guy. 
Speaker MODERATOR: ",And I am sure every person here really really wants you to join our group.
"Speaker SCOTT: He doesn't need to be sarcastic. I mean, that was sarcasm wasn't it? 
Speaker MEMBER-GIRL: ",Really?
"Speaker RACHEL: I'm really glad Monica asked us out. 
Speaker PERSON: I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.

Speaker LEONARD: Thats what he used to eat his pudding, remember? 
Speaker RAJ: ",Right. That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
"Speaker PHOEBE: Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",Okay?
"Speaker PENNY: A marathon? How many Superman movies are there? 
Speaker SHELDON: You're kidding, right? 
Speaker PENNY: I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that? 
Speaker SHELDON: One. 
Speaker SHELDON: You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy. 
Speaker PENNY: Yes, I know, men can't fly. 
Speaker SHELDON: Let's assume that they can. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces."
"Speaker JOEY: Uh, okay, Pheebs? 
Speaker PHOEBE: Yeah? 
Speaker JOEY: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?

Speaker RAJ: W-Which is cool.
I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...
Cool. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Darn. If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us."
"Speaker JOEY: When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, it wouldn't matter. Now I got to be careful? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",I'm sorry man there is never a good time to have to .. Stop catching on fire.
"Speaker SHELDON: to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins? 
Speaker LEONARD: No, Penny kissed me. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
"Speaker MONICA: You are dead meat 
Speaker CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret. 
Speaker MONICA: ","No its not big, not at all. Kind of the same lines as, I don't know, having a third nipple!"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Damn, tail pipe's not hot enough to light this. 
Speaker JOEY: Relax ok? I can get this open, anybody got a coat hangar? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh I do. Oh no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."

Speaker ROSS: ",DANGER

Speaker SHELDON: I'm no stranger to a little gray matter. 
Speaker SHELDON: Locus coeruleus. 
Speaker SHELDON: Locus coeruleus. 
Speaker AMY: You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain. 
Speaker AMY: ","Hope your hands are steady. It's the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem for a genius like you."
"Speaker JOEY: Are you referring to my man's bag? At first it I thought it just look good. But its practical too, check it out! Its got compartments for all your stuff. Your wallet, your key, your addressbook. 
Speaker ROSS: ",Your makeup?
"Speaker CHANDLER: How old is that sock!. If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years, it would be talking too. 
Speaker ROSS: Okay, I think its time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
"Speaker MONICA: Let's try a look .. of far off .. wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! 
Speaker MONICA: ",What is the matter with your face?!
"Speaker PHOEBE: Definitely! 
Speaker RACHEL: Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! 
Speaker RACHEL: ",It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
"Speaker DOROTHY: Its Miami in June, only cats are wearing fur! 
Speaker ROSE: You going out? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","No, she is going to sit here where itÕs a 112 degrees and eat enchiladas."
"Speaker HOWARD: So nice you could join me this evening. 
Speaker HOWARD: You're looking lovely as always. 
Speaker PERSON: Thanks, Howard.  Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies. 
Speaker HOWARD: Come on, Katee. Don't make it sound so cheap. 
Speaker PERSON: ","I'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act."
"Speaker JOEY: Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. 
Speaker JOEY: ",Take a couple deep breaths.
"Speaker PHOEBE: And! And! 
Speaker RACHEL: Ah! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Hey, my father's house does that."
"Speaker DOROTHY: She is miserable. 
Speaker ROSE: Just to keep me upto speed Dorothy, it is this negligent arson that prospect of spending the rest of her wiening years in jail thing right? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ",No itÕs the rose in the kitchen thing.
"Speaker ROSS: And now you want that money back. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Exactly. 
Speaker ROSS: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",It's not a real game! I made it up!
"Speaker SHELDON: There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, color and consistency. 
Speaker PENNY: Disgusting. 
Speaker LEONARD: No, what's disgusting is he's still keeping track. 
Speaker PENNY: Why do you need all this stuff...? 
Speaker LEONARD: No, no, no, no... Sorry! 
Speaker SHELDON: I am glad you asked. 
Speaker SHELDON: Yeah, are you familiar with the Higgs boson? 
Speaker PENNY: ","Of course, it is... it's been in the news. And it's a very famous boson."
"Speaker PERSON: But that reminds me, sign this. 
Speaker ROSS: What is it? 
Speaker PERSON: Its nothing, just that you can't sue the city incase you scrap your knee or your know get your head blown off. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh hurry up, I want to sign that."
"Speaker HOWARD: Don't push me, Sheldon.
I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it. 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, really? 
Speaker SHELDON: Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister. 
Speaker SHELDON: And I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation-- be it noogies, swirlies or the classic ""Why are you hitting yourself?"" 
Speaker RAJ: ","Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Could you want her more? 
Speaker ROSS: Who? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Dee. The sarcastic sister from What's Happening.

Speaker LEONARD: Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date. 
Speaker SHELDON: It's 8:00 in the morning in Mumbai. 
How can she have dinner? 
Speaker LEONARD: Fine, whatever. 
Priya will be having breakfast. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, ""Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"""
"Speaker JOEY: Whoa! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",See Joe that's why your parents told you not to jump on your bed!
"Speaker SHELDON: It is, isn't it? 
Speaker SHELDON: (gasps) Oh, bother. 
Speaker SHELDON: Isn't that just always the way? 
You go to staple something, and you're out of staples. 
Speaker SHELDON: Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples. 
Speaker RAJ: ",You have a thing of paper clips right there.
"Speaker PHOEBE: Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha! 
Speaker MONICA: Very good,  so good. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ","I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
"Speaker PERSON: Thank you for driving me back to my hotel. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh,it's not a problem. 
Speaker PERSON: ","I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery."
"Speaker JOEY: Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. 
Speaker JOEY: ","Whoa, maybe I was!"
"Speaker RAJ: You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it's also gross. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?
"Speaker SHELDON: Really? 
Speaker AMY: Yes. 
Speaker SHELDON: Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. 
Speaker SHELDON: That's why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. 
Hmm. 
Speaker AMY: I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Not as relieved as I'm about to be. It's a brave new world, little lady."
"Speaker PHOEBE: Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Well sensitive is important, pick him. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Yeah. 
Speaker JOEY: ","Oh sure, go with the sissy."

Speaker ROSS: spring vacation. 
Speaker PERSON: Oh good. 
Speaker ROSS: Look, I ..   Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. 
Speaker ROSS: ","So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet."
"Speaker ROSS: Maybe I should get another pair. Oh, you know they had some with uh, with  fringe all down the sides. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Pheebs, you may know this, you know strange things. What is the boiling point of brain?"
"Speaker LEONARD: But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me. 
Speaker PENNY: Really? 
Speaker LEONARD: Yes. It's all on you. 
Speaker LEONARD: But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. 
Speaker LEONARD: I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I want to be swept off my feet. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, you got it. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",And I'm cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don't want to cry on a big screen like that.
"Speaker AMY: Oh... then I choose a janitor.
'Cause I'm about to throw up. 
Speaker LEONARD: I'm in love.
Let's do something else. 
Speaker RAJ: Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.
Why don't the four of us go out? 
Speaker AMY: Okay. Sounds good. 
Speaker LEONARD: Should we call Howard and Bernadette? 
Speaker RAJ: I don't know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text. 
Speaker AMY: Did he say anything about the funeral? 
Speaker RAJ: ","Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
"Speaker JOEY: Quack quack, quack quack, quack quack. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
"Speaker SCOTT: Alright! Definitely! 
Speaker MEMBER-GIRL: ",Sarcasm? At a sarcasmoholics meeting?
"Speaker RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
"Speaker RACHEL: You know? Forget it! 
Speaker JOEY: No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about? 
Speaker RACHEL: No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know 
Speaker JOEY: ",Ok!
"Speaker CHANDLER: I want to show you something too. You know those big road signs that say Merge? So I was thinking that we could get one fo those signs and hang it over the bed. Because its you and I together - Merge! 
Speaker MONICA: ",Oh my God I love that! - Really? - NO!
"Speaker CHANDLER: Mmm 
Speaker ROSS: Mmm 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","This is so good, that I am gonna enjoy it in the balcony. I can enjoy my view, whilst I enjoy my desert."

Speaker PHOEBE: Oh its Dr. Suse. 
Speaker JOEY: That book got me through some tough times 
Speaker PERSON: There is a little child inside this man. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Yes, the doctor's say if they remove it, he will die!"
"Speaker SHELDON: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right? 
Speaker LEONARD: Right. 
Speaker SHELDON: Is it about me or the dead pixels? 
Speaker RAJ: Hey, you're just in time. We made Tex-Mex. 
Speaker LEONARD: Oh, sounds great. 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. 
Speaker SHELDON: Might as well have had the Chinese pizza. 
Speaker PERSON: Hey, you. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey, I need you to set me up for a joke. Later when Monica is around I need you to ask me about firetrucks 
Speaker JOEY: I don't know Chandler, I am not so good with remembering lines. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Well thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
"Speaker JOEY: My family's been going to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait 16. Excuse me, 15 ...  Alright when was 1990? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",You have to stop the Q-Tip when there is resistance
"Speaker CHANDLER: Listen it's kind of an emergency 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",I guess you would know that or else we would be in a predicament room
"Speaker HOWARD: There are always do-overs when my people play sports. 
Speaker SHELDON: Where were you that's more important than Wii bowling night? 
Speaker LEONARD: Actually... 
Speaker SHELDON: It's rhetorical.
There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night. 
Speaker LEONARD: Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it. 
Speaker SHELDON: Nice motivational speech from the team captain. 
Speaker SHELDON: Where were you? 
Speaker HOWARD: ","""Dave."" Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF."
"Speaker SHELDON: Who touched my… 
Speaker HOWARD: Penny! Penny did it. 
Speaker SHELDON: Why would you do that? 
Speaker PENNY: I don't know. I was hungry?
What's the big deal? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
"Speaker AMY: It's nice they're getting exercise. 
Speaker SHELDON: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. 
Speaker AMY: I'm sure he brought it. 
Speaker SHELDON: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it. 
Speaker AMY: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. 
Speaker AMY: ","He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it."
"Speaker LEONARD: Well, that's it. 
Speaker LEONARD: That's the end of Roger Abbott. 
Speaker RAJ: And we still don't know who framed him. 
Speaker LEONARD: I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
"Speaker PENNY: Everybody's staring at me. 
Speaker LEONARD: Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them. 
Speaker PENNY: Unlikely. 
Speaker PENNY: Here, what about this one for my nephew? 
Speaker SHELDON: A superb choice. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, great. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Provided he has already read and is familiar with the reestablishment of the DC multiverse.
"Speaker LEONARD: Okay, why? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.
