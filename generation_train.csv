Speaker RAJ: What do you mean? 
Speaker PERSON: Well, you're acting all weird.
And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about.

Speaker ROSE: Dorothy, should I get Sophia a glass of water? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","Rose, you should sit here and watch her hack herself to death"

Speaker RAJ: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, I meant beer pong.

Speaker BERNADETTE: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it. 
Speaker AMY: ","And if I had a friend, they might have told me that."
"Speaker SHELDON: Who will stand between us and flag ignorance"""" 
Speaker AMY: I know I was thinking that.
Is this a show on flags or mind reading? 
Speaker SHELDON: But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend. 
Speaker AMY: And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","So as they say, all good things must come to an end."

Speaker JOEY: Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys. 
Speaker PHOEBE: I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",I don't think you could ever do that.
"Speaker PENNY: This is amazing.
How did you even get this idea? 
Speaker LEONARD: I called your dad.
I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid.

Speaker PENNY: Okay, you're kind of really great. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
"Speaker JOEY: I just want to go back to my cell, cause in my cell I can smoke.

Speaker AMY: You should get one. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: What's that? 
Speaker AMY: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh, God, that is so romantic. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, it was. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Leonard's really one of a kind. 
Speaker AMY: ","Saying that while holding a snowflake is a bit heavy-handed, don't you think?"
"Speaker HOWARD: I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner. 
Speaker LEONARD: Sure. The more, the merrier. 
Speaker SHELDON: Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. 
Speaker SHELDON: If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating. 
Speaker LEONARD: Sheldon... 
Speaker SHELDON: Don't ""Sheldon"" me. We ordered for five people, not six. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
"Speaker JOEY: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay  you that money back and I don't want that hanging on my head. Besides, soon as my insurance kicks in I' ll all the free operations I want. T'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.

Speaker ROSS: Dude, what am I gonna 
Speaker JOEY: ","Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
"Speaker SHELDON: It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house and have anything better to do.

Speaker SHELDON: I don't know the future. 
Speaker SHELDON: Do you think there's a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it? 
Speaker AMY: No, Sheldon. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Then buckle up; you're in for a cranky night.

"Speaker SHELDON: Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus? 
Speaker HOWARD: My guess is, ""Hey, four minutes! New record!"" 
Speaker HOWARD: That's why I'm the funny one. 
Speaker LEONARD: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff. 
Speaker HOWARD: They were closing up. We got this whole box for 60 bucks. 
Speaker LEONARD: We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here. 
Speaker PENNY: ",There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.
"Speaker MODERATOR: Well we have a new member of Sarcasmoholics Anonymous this week

Speaker CHANDLER: ",Actually I yesterday I was smoking again. Today I am smoking still.
"Speaker RACHEL: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. 
Speaker MONICA: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. 
Speaker RACHEL: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! 
Speaker MONICA: ",You had no relationship!!
"Speaker SHELDON: the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right. 
Speaker SHELDON: And now he's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, that's basically what I said. 
Speaker SHELDON: The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, 
Speaker SHELDON: perhaps I've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",I didn't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
"Speaker SHELDON: I may have failed. 
Speaker HOWARD: Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman. 
Speaker PERSON: I don't want to go without Penny. 
Speaker RAJ: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
"Speaker HOWARD: Say what? 
Speaker HOWARD: That's basically what I just said. 
Speaker LEONARD: You brought your husband to work. You know the rules. 
Speaker LEONARD: Mesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha. 
Speaker PERSON: Leonard, it's 1:00. Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00? 
Speaker LEONARD: ",There's no hurry. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.
"Speaker LEONARD: Yup, oh... here you go. 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, thank you. 
Speaker SHELDON: Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles. 
Speaker LEONARD: Oh-ho.
I forgot about this. 
My aunt made it for me when I started college. 
Speaker PENNY: Aw, did she hate you? 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite."
"Speaker PERSON: and pump it into his mom's Camry. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, that's great. It's a funny story. Moving on. 
Speaker PERSON: And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics. 
Speaker PERSON: What was his name, sweetheart? 
Speaker PENNY: Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking. 
Speaker PERSON: I don't know. That petition looked real to me. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening. 
Speaker PERSON: ","Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper."
"Speaker LEONARD: Okay. So... we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, 
Speaker LEONARD: ","said horrible things about each other in public... all in all, a pretty magical night."
"Speaker PENNY: I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Right here. 
Speaker PENNY: You guys are the best. 
Speaker AMY: What's with the clothes? 
Speaker PENNY: Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet. 
Speaker AMY: I meant why are they folded? 
But whatever. 
Speaker AMY: Ooh, what's this? 
Speaker PENNY: That, believe it or not, is my prom dress. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ","Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
"Speaker AMY: we decided that the time was right to take a step forward. 
Speaker LEONARD: Okay. 
Speaker SHELDON: Do you want to say it? 
Speaker AMY: Let's say it together. 
Speaker SHELDON: We're getting a turtle! 
Speaker PENNY: ",This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
"Speaker PENNY: Hey Sheldon. 
Speaker SHELDON: Hello Penny. 
Speaker PENNY: Get anything good? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics quarterly.
"Speaker LEONARD: I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. 
Speaker PENNY: ",Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.
"Speaker PERSON: I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on. Hey everybody! 
Speaker PERSON: ","Uh, I'm gonna kill myself!"
"Speaker HOWARD: he used to... take me to the comic book store. 
Speaker HOWARD: It was one of the few things we did together. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh. Howie, I had no idea. 
Speaker HOWARD: Well, I don't... like to talk about it. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh, baby. 
That story's made up, isn't it? 
Speaker HOWARD: ",That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.
"Speaker HOWARD: Hey, have you told your parents you're dating this short glass of skim milk here? 
Speaker PERSON: Uh... that's different.
First of all, we're not engaged; and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children. 
Speaker HOWARD: Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
"Speaker ROSS: That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Okay? Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... 
Speaker ROSS: ",It's not funny!
"Speaker RAJ: I've missed you. 
Speaker SHELDON: All right, say hello to your mother for me. 
Speaker HOWARD: Okay. 
Speaker SHELDON: What? 
Speaker HOWARD: You said you were going for a walk. 
Speaker SHELDON: I didn't say outside. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
"Speaker PERSON: I don't want to rush you, but I'm closing a little early tonight. 
Speaker RAJ: Ooh. Hot date? 
Speaker PERSON: ","Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don't have to not ask me twice."
"Speaker PHOEBE: So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ","All right, okay, well, apparently not!"
"Speaker PERSON: Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.

Speaker PERSON: What is going on? 
Speaker ROSS: ",What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
"Speaker DOROTHY: You what the joke going around teacher's lounge was today Ma? Me 
Speaker SOPHIA: I know this joke 
Speaker DOROTHY: Everybody heard on the radio that some anonymous Ma was complaining that her dependent daughter Dorothy doesn't have a life of her own. 
Speaker SOPHIA: What you think of the only grey head substitute teacher named Dorothy wasting her life away in Miami? 
Speaker ROSE: ","I'm sorry Sophia, but in Dorothy's defence, it sure sounds a lot like her."
"Speaker AMY: but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession.
I'm the reason it was pulled. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: What? How? 
Speaker AMY: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Amy, what did you say? 
Speaker AMY: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ","Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche."
"Speaker JOEY: Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" 
Speaker JOEY: ","And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
"Speaker PERSON: So you have replaced me. 
Speaker ROSE: With what? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ",A hand puppet Rose.
"Speaker CHANDLER: Saucy. 
Speaker PERSON: I'll be back in two minutes. 
Speaker CHANDLER: You are going to leave me like this 
Speaker PERSON: Knowing you are here, waiting for me, it is kind of exciting isn't it? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Okay, but if you are not coming back soon, there is pretty much nothing I can do about it"
"Speaker LEONARD: It's 2:00 a.m. What are you doing up? 
Speaker SHELDON: Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
"Speaker PERSON: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things. 
Speaker ROSS: No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called. 
Speaker PERSON: ","Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else."
"Speaker MONICA: You owe me 20 bucks. 
Speaker RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you so much! 
Speaker MONICA: Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. 
Speaker RACHEL: ","Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?"
"Speaker SHELDON: Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her? 
Speaker LEONARD: Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way. 
Speaker SHELDON: How would you put it? 
Speaker LEONARD: Yeah, okay, like you said. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse.
"Speaker SHELDON: Of course not. I'm a theoretical physicist.
A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientis to confirm string theory. 
Speaker SHELDON: People will write books about me. 
Speaker SHELDON: Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
"Speaker HOWARD: Unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I'm sober. 
Speaker RAJ: You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty. 
Speaker HOWARD: You know the old saying, ""Pasty and frail never fail."" 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?"
"Speaker PHOEBE: And there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Oh! Satan's minions at work again?
"Speaker MONICA: I am sorry I think I can walk the rest of the way now just give me my boots. 
Speaker CHANDLER: I don't have your boots 
Speaker MONICA: Well I don't have them either, where are they? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Well why don't you check in one of my saddle bags while I chew on a bale of hay.
"Speaker BERNADETTE: So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.
We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. 
Speaker AMY: Can I be in charge of pricing?
I've been going to garage sales my whole life. 
Speaker AMY: Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? 
Speaker HOWARD: ","All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75."
"Speaker LEONARD: The surf and turf sounds good.
See if they corn on the cob. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Guys!
We're trying to get him out of here, not you in. 
Speaker RAJ: You're wasting your time.
Just please, leave me alone. 
Speaker HOWARD: Now what? 
Speaker LEONARD: I don't know. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ",We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We're all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
"Speaker SHELDON: Okay, all right. 
Speaker SHELDON: That one was clever. 
Speaker SHELDON: Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. 
Speaker SHELDON: Come on out, merry pranksters. 
Speaker SHELDON: Take a bow. 
Speaker RAJ: You should've seen your face. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
"Speaker ROSS: It's from France .. In Europe .. Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe. 
Speaker PERSON: Really? 
Speaker ROSS: Uh-hmm,Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona. 
Speaker PERSON: ",I studied for a year in Barcelona.
"Speaker RACHEL: You can't go away this weekend, its Emma's birthday, we are having a party. 
Speaker MONICA: Well can't you just have the party when we get back? 
Speaker RACHEL: No, it won't be her real birthday. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Gee, if only she were one and had no idea what a birthday was."
"Speaker SHELDON: And a living will and durable power of attorney. 
Speaker RAJ: This says you can make ""end of life"" decisions for me. 
Speaker SHELDON: As your friend, let's hope it doesn't come to that. 
Please sign. 
Speaker RAJ: Did you sign this? 
Speaker LEONARD: There's a reciprocity clause.
You get to pull the plug on him, too. 
Speaker RAJ: Well, that seems fair. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here's your I.D. card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hi, excuse me, is Rachel Green here? I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.

Speaker ROSS: ",I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
"Speaker PENNY: Hey, how are things going with your parents? 
Speaker RAJ: Not great. They hired divorce attorneys. 
Speaker SHELDON: You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk. 
Speaker PENNY: ","You know what? That was almost on topic. I'm gonna say, ""Good job, Sheldon."""
"Speaker CHANDLER: Anybody know a good tailor? 
Speaker JOEY: You needs some clothes altered? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","No, no, I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
"Speaker HOWARD: to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation. 
Speaker RAJ: Way to make lemonade.
You know, from around the corner where fudge is made. 
Speaker HOWARD: Hey, I got a favor to ask. 
Speaker RAJ: Sure. 
Speaker HOWARD: My mom's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her. 
Speaker RAJ: ","Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Okay you are right, I am in love with Joey's girlfriend. 
Speaker PHOEBE: What? How is that possible? You barely know her.

Speaker MONICA: Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy. 
Speaker JOEY: ","Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
"Speaker DOROTHY: We clinked at the glasses, Stan gave me a toy smile and I winked at him 
Speaker DOROTHY: And then I gulped down the champaigne in one go 
Speaker DOROTHY: And it didn't go sdown smoothly 
Speaker DOROTHY: Later Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass 
Speaker DOROTHY: It turned up three days later. 
Speaker ROSE: Where did it turn up Dorothy? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ",On the home shopping network
"Speaker LEONARD: Here we go. Pad thai, no peanuts. 
Speaker HOWARD: But does it have peanut oil? 
Speaker LEONARD: I'm not sure. Everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
"Speaker PENNY: Come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening. 
Speaker PERSON: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese. 
Speaker PENNY: You know, it's kind of early.

Speaker CHANDLER: No 
Speaker MONICA: Just do it! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh Oh, I am convinced!"
"Speaker SHELDON: I don't think there's anything in this jewelry store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff. 
Speaker SHELDON: Ooh, a pocket watch. 
Speaker PENNY: Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
"Speaker LEONARD: Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit. 
Speaker PENNY: Ok, alright, moving on. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, wow. A paisley shirt. 
Speaker LEONARD: It goes with my corduroy suit.

Speaker LEONARD: ","Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice... It's reversible!"

"Speaker JOEY: Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready? 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",Uh-huh!
"Speaker RACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. 
Speaker RACHEL: ","I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
"Speaker SHELDON: This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

Speaker LEONARD: So, how is she? 
Speaker HOWARD: They're running tests-- I don't know. 
Speaker HOWARD: It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event. 
Speaker PENNY: What's the difference?

Speaker RACHEL: ",No.
"Speaker SHELDON: It was a compromise. I lost. 
Speaker RAJ: Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party? 
Speaker HOWARD: Who cares? 
Speaker RAJ: What do you mean ""who cares""? Look at what I pulled off here.
The deejay's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food! 
Speaker RAJ: Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old!"
"Speaker ROSS: So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ... 
Speaker PERSON: and live forever as a machine! 
Speaker ROSS: That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? 
Speaker ROSS: ","You and I, we're interfacing."

Speaker AMY: ","Oh, I could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids."
"Speaker SHELDON: Or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude. Or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements. 
Speaker SHELDON: Or his feelings about little marshmallows.

Speaker BERNADETTE: Without asking me? 
Speaker HOWARD: There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: How much, Howie? 
Speaker HOWARD: Not a lot. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: How much? 
Speaker HOWARD: ",Let's not talk about this in front of our friends.
"Speaker SHELDON: You know, there-there's always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? 
Speaker SHELDON: That-That's just as good. 
Speaker SHELDON: Excuse me.

Speaker PENNY: And in a different way than it was 20 minutes ago. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
"Speaker PENNY: What exactly do you think goes on here? 
Speaker SHELDON: Well...
conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. 
Speaker SHELDON: You know, who has the best cervix. 
Speaker SHELDON: Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. 
Speaker SHELDON: Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: We were talking about Penny's job. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","And how difficult it is to do when she's bloated, cranky and crampy?"
"Speaker PHOEBE: Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay! 
Speaker RACHEL: Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?! 
Speaker PHOEBE: Hey Rach! 
Speaker RACHEL: ",What was that?!
"Speaker BERNADETTE: What's going on in here? 
Speaker HOWARD: I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.

Speaker HOWARD: ","Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
"Speaker SHELDON: Wow. I don't know which hurts worse-- my nose or my heart. 
Speaker SHELDON: Well, I'm done speaking to you. 
Speaker AMY: Don't be like that. You two need to talk this out. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, 'cause you sound really funny. 
Speaker LEONARD: Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose."
"Speaker RACHEL: Where's Chandler? 
Speaker PHOEBE: Oh, he needed some time to grieve. 
Speaker CHANDLER: I'm free! I'm free!

Speaker PERSON: Well, it's so nice to see you, too. 
Speaker PERSON: I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list. Oh, that would be mighty white of you."
"Speaker PHOEBE: How do you feel? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Okay, so I 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",And protected them from a tornado?
"Speaker LEONARD: Let me ask you something. 
Speaker LEONARD: Do you think it's okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch? 
Speaker HOWARD: No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line. 
Speaker LEONARD: Thank you! 
Speaker HOWARD: ","But if she dumps you, she'll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you'll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right? 
Speaker MONICA: Yes, hi. 
Speaker PERSON: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry."
"Speaker ROSS: After the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. - And she said - ""No no, its too cold, nobody will go out there.""  - I said ""Maybe if we put some lights out there they will""."
"Speaker PERSON: Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Ah you see perfect might be a problem. Had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.
"Speaker PENNY: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago. 
Speaker RAJ: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us. 
Speaker PERSON: Mm. I'd like that, too. 
Speaker PERSON: Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, that's so sweet.
I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous. 
Speaker RAJ: ",It's true-- you're both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both.
"Speaker PHOEBE: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?! 
Speaker ROSS: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were feeling better. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Thank God. 
Speaker ROSS: ","Yeah, she's fired."
"Speaker MONICA: No. 
Speaker CHANDLER: How long have we been home? 
Speaker MONICA: About a half an hour. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Lovely
"Speaker PERSON2: Your mom called me. So is this her? 
Speaker PERSON1: No, this is a loaner. 
Speaker PERSON2: I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. 
Speaker PERSON1: ","I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: How many times have I told you guys, you 
Speaker MONICA: Hi Chandler. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Hey! 
Speaker MONICA: ","Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
"Speaker CHANDLER: I will have one. Okay, I'm not gonna have one. 
Speaker PHOEBE: No, no, it's just my tooth. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",All right I'll have one.
"Speaker PERSON: He switched over to high-energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. 
Speaker PERSON: You're in? 
Speaker LEONARD: Yeah, sure, why not? 
Speaker PERSON: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place. 
Speaker LEONARD: Why at my place? 
Speaker PERSON: Department of Energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. 
Speaker PERSON: Nice meeting you. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, you, too.
Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough."
"Speaker HOWARD: It's smashed beyond repair. What are you gonna do with it? 
Speaker RAJ: What else? Sell it on eBay as ""slightly used."" 
Speaker LEONARD: It was Penny's boyfriend's, they broke up. 
Speaker HOWARD: Apparently, he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which I cannot find anywhere. 
Speaker LEONARD: I'm gonna go back and try talking to her again. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Good idea, sit with her. Hold her, comfort her. And if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel."
"Speaker SHELDON: And I'm super smart, so it's probably true. 
Speaker AMY: Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. 
Speaker AMY: You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom. 
Speaker SHELDON: I'm sorry! It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet. 
Speaker AMY: Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged. It's the same reason Einstein failed math.
"Speaker HOWARD: So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home. 
Speaker PERSON: Okay. Let's go, friend Leonard. 
Speaker HOWARD: I'll call ya. 
Speaker PERSON: So are you a scientist like Howard? 
Speaker LEONARD: No one's a scientist like Howard. 
Speaker HOWARD: My mother is so gonna love her. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",How nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.
"Speaker ROSS: Oh. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like  'Is it on the lose?'  'Is it watching me?' 
Speaker CHANDLER: We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. 
Speaker ROSS: ","He's right, even if it's to say something complementary."
"Speaker JOEY: Helo! Anybody in there order a celebrity? 
Speaker PERSON: What was that?

"Speaker HOWARD: This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet. 
Speaker LEONARD: I feel terrible 
Speaker HOWARD: Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself. 
Speaker LEONARD: I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny. 
Speaker RAJ: Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?"

Speaker RAJ: No, no, I don't know if I should. 
If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. 
Speaker RAJ: It's almost like I'm reading her diary. 
Speaker HOWARD: That's exactly what it's like. Keep reading. 
Speaker RAJ: No, this is creepy. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera."

Speaker LEONARD: What? 
Speaker SHELDON: Nothing. 
Speaker LEONARD: Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement."
"Speaker JOEY: Hey. What, what are you doing here? 
Speaker PHOEBE: Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...

Speaker ROSS: ",Hey! It's starting to snow.
"Speaker ROSS: One, two, three, four! You know the song! Sing along! So? 
Speaker MONICA: ",No!
"Speaker PERSON: When their pets pass on, they want them sort of laid out like they are sleeping. But, occassionally theres a person who wants them in a pose like chasing their tail or uh, jumping to catch a frizbee. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Joey if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys"
"Speaker RACHEL: I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.

Speaker MEMBER-BOY: ",You got off to a really good start with the group.
"Speaker RAJ: Oh, there it is: now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again. 
Speaker LEONARD: I never stopped hanging out with you. Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman. 
Speaker HOWARD: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
"Speaker ROSS: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?

Speaker JOEY: ",Hey.
"Speaker JOEY: Hey 
Speaker CHANDLER: Hey 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","You know once you are inside, you don't have to knock anymore."
"Speaker SHELDON: Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey. 
Speaker PERSON: Thank you.
Neat<i> Star Trek</i> mug. 
Speaker PERSON: I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show. 
Speaker HOWARD: Oh, cool.
How'd you get that? 
Speaker PERSON: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy. 
Speaker SHELDON: Wait a minute.
You've snipped Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens? 
Speaker PERSON: Yes. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
"Speaker CHANDLER: I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do"". 
Speaker MONICA: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. 
Speaker CHANDLER: David is going to propose to Phoebe. 
Speaker MONICA: ",What?  Why?
"Speaker AMY: the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. 
Speaker AMY: Is there something wrong with your neck? 
Speaker SHELDON: It's a little stiff. 
Speaker SHELDON: What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. 
Speaker SHELDON: Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick. 
Speaker AMY: Have you considered massage? 
Speaker SHELDON: ","I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
"Speaker JOEY: Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! 
Speaker JOEY: ",I talk to you and nothin'.
"Speaker HOWARD: after you had a snootful of this, laddie! 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Funny. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: You boys have a nice time? 
Speaker HOWARD: Yeah, it was great. 
Speaker HOWARD: Low-key, like I promised. 
No hanky-panky, no strippers.
Just the guys telling jokes. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: That's nice. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
"Speaker SHELDON: That lecture was a waste of time. 
Speaker SHELDON: I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
Speaker AMY: Are you getting sick? 
Speaker SHELDON: ","No, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
"Speaker RACHEL: Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? 
Speaker PERSON: Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. Ohh that's nice. 
Speaker PERSON: ",Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
"Speaker PERSON: Aren't you with that girl over there? 
Speaker ROSS: Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. 
Speaker ROSS: ","No, no, no, it's flattery."
"Speaker ROSS: Hi. 
Speaker RACHEL: What's the matter with you? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Mean guys at the coffee house took my hat 
Speaker JOEY: You kidding 
Speaker ROSS: It was ridiculous, these guys were bullies, actual bullies. We are grown ups, this kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh, wait a minute, I have no one."
"Speaker SHELDON: What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person? 
Speaker LEONARD: Look at us, Sheldon.
We're the crazy people. 
Speaker SHELDON: Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence. 
Speaker HOWARD: Good idea.
Why don't you get started on that? 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby."
"Speaker CHANDLER: I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. 
Speaker JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. 
Speaker JOEY: ","It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller."
"Speaker PERSON: Excuse me, Dr. Cooper. I'm Kathy O'Brien. 
Speaker PERSON: I just finished reading your paper reconciling the black hole information paradox with your theory of string-network condensates, and it just took my breath away. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler."
"Speaker JOEY: When that guy was robbing us and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, do you know what I was doing there in all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down. Yeah. But if I had known what kind of friend you would turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around! 
Speaker CHANDLER: Wait! Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do, something. If we still had that entertainment unit, I would get in there for six hours and think about  how I let you down. 
Speaker JOEY: ",We got a box.
"Speaker JOEY: And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before. 
Speaker MONICA: Is he doing his shark attack bit yet? 
Speaker JOEY: ","Nope. Op, wait! There he goes."
"Speaker SHELDON: in town were starting to say I was a witch. 
Speaker PERSON: Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis. 
Speaker PENNY: Oh, it's about time. I hated the old way. 
Speaker PENNY: Hi. I'm Penny. 
Speaker PERSON: Alex.
Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter? 
Speaker PENNY: In a way. 
Speaker PENNY: ",We've kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
"Speaker JOEY: You liked it? You really liked it? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! 
Speaker JOEY: Which part exactly? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",The whole thing! Can we go?
"Speaker LEONARD: You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night? 
Speaker SHELDON: He didn't respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was. 
Speaker LEONARD: You could have waited until morning. 
Speaker LEONARD: I know, look who I'm talking to. 
Speaker SHELDON: Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole? 
Speaker LEONARD: ",Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.
"Speaker JOEY: Oh Mommy, Oh Daddy, I am a big ol Baddy. 
Speaker ROSS: I guess he must have gotten the part in the play. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Yeah either that or gloria estefan was right eventually the rhythm is going to get you
"Speaker JOEY: It isnt working 
Speaker MONICA: We have to unscrew the chain 
Speaker JOEY: Hurry, I can't feel my ears 
Speaker CHANDLER: Can you ever feel your ears? 
Speaker JOEY: Interesting 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Oh I left them in my bulldozer .. I don't have tools!
"Speaker CHANDLER: The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has gotten away. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","No, no the actual cartoon character .. Of course the baloon."
"Speaker PHOEBE: Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",Okay?
"Speaker LEONARD: This isn't so bad. 
Speaker SHELDON: That's easy for you to say. 
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section. 
Speaker SHELDON: Boy, that's a lot of panties. 
Speaker AMY: You guys comfy? This might take a while. 
Speaker SHELDON: You know, I don't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes. 
Speaker PENNY: ","No, you're right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston."
"Speaker PHOEBE: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself? 
Speaker PERSON: It's just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist! 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",Chandler?
"Speaker MONICA: Oh wait stop! Stop! Stop! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh I am sorry, do you need a break?"
"Speaker JOEY: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before. 
Speaker MONICA: ",What are you up too?
"Speaker RACHEL: Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! 
Speaker RACHEL: ","I did not mean to touch that,I mean"
"Speaker LEONARD: I don't think I can go to the North Pole. 
Speaker SHELDON: I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low. 
Speaker LEONARD: Yeah, that's very comforting. 
Speaker SHELDON: Comforting is a part of leadership.
It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Terrific, it's just that... I don't think Penny wants me to go."
"Speaker RACHEL: Oh Monica, we are so sorry. 
Speaker MONICA: For what? 
Speaker RACHEL: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
"Speaker CHANDLER: Okay. 
Speaker JOEY: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh yeah man.  Joey. 
Speaker PERSON: ",Hey.
"Speaker BERNADETTE: What the hell is wrong with you?! 
Speaker RAJ: Well...
You were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: I'm nice to everyone! 
Speaker RAJ: I'm sorry. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Damn right, you're sorry! 
Speaker BERNADETTE: And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us! 
Speaker RAJ: I will. Hey, Bernadette? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: What?! 
Speaker RAJ: Do you think I have a shot with Penny? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ",Of course you do. You're a cutie pie! Any girl would be lucky to have you!
"Speaker MONICA: Go over to her. She's not with anyone. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Oh yeah right. And what would my opening line be? Excuse me
"Speaker RACHEL: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night. 
Speaker JOEY: Yeah me too, all night. Really?! 
Speaker RACHEL: How come we didn't cross paths? 
Speaker JOEY: ","Yeah well that's because uh .. I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper."
"Speaker SHELDON: Pastries such as bear claws? 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, sure. 
Speaker SHELDON: I don't like bear claws. 
Speaker PERSON: Hey, Penny. 
Speaker PERSON: Dumbass. 
Speaker SHELDON: Leslie Winkle. 
Speaker SHELDON: Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle? 
Speaker PENNY: They have a lot in common. I mean, they're both scientists. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space."
"Speaker RAJ: It's actually a very elegant system. You know, what goes around comes around. 
Speaker HOWARD: Speaking of what goes around comes around... 
Speaker RAJ: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely? 
Speaker SHELDON: It won't work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient. 
Speaker RAJ: What if we reposition the collection tank? 
Speaker SHELDON: It won't work. No way to mount it. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, Avi, in Israel?"
"Speaker RAJ: There are many things seriously wrong with me. 
Speaker RAJ: And not quirks, either.
Like... diagnosable psychological problems. 
Speaker RAJ: Maybe brain damage. 
Speaker PERSON: Well, how do I know you're not just saying that? 
Speaker RAJ: ","Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you'll see."
"Speaker JOEY: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... 
Speaker CHANDLER: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Oh, that's Ross's. 
Speaker RACHEL: Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Remembered what? 
Speaker RACHEL: ",It was like months ago.
"Speaker PHOEBE: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. 
Speaker PERSON: Hi! 
Speaker RACHEL: This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  You're Bonnie? 
Speaker PERSON: ",I can show you an ID if you want?
"Speaker SHELDON: it will establish you as the ""alpha"" male. 
Speaker SHELDON: You see... when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination, she produces the hormone oxytocin. 
Speaker SHELDON: If the two of you then engage in intercourse, this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as ""falling in love."" 
Speaker LEONARD: Huh 
Speaker LEONARD: ",Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
"Speaker LEONARD: You never told me what happened between you and Bernadette. 
Speaker HOWARD: I did a stupid thing. 
Speaker LEONARD: Yeah, I guessed that. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

Speaker CHANDLER: Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"". 
Speaker MONICA: ","Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."

Speaker PHOEBE: You think you know me so well. 
Speaker MONICA: ","Well, don't  'cha wanna?"
"Speaker LEONARD: Take that! 
Speaker LEONARD: What's the matter? 
Speaker HOWARD: This granola bar has peanuts in it! 
Speaker LEONARD: Oh, my God. Why did you eat it? 
Speaker HOWARD: I don't know. It was just there! 
Speaker LEONARD: If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?

"Speaker SHELDON: When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. 
Speaker SHELDON: It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. 
Speaker SHELDON: For some reason, I related to it quite strongly. 
Speaker PENNY: I know the reason. 
Speaker LEONARD: We all know the reason. 
Speaker LEONARD: Sheldon, what are you getting at? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Panchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
"Speaker SHELDON: Wrong. Leonard? 
Speaker LEONARD: Horse, but mostly just for the height. 
Speaker LEONARD: A little bit for the genital girth. 
Speaker SHELDON: Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we? 
Speaker HOWARD: Kangaroo, uh, I'd be Kanga-Jew. 
Speaker HOWARD: The first of my people to dunk a basketball. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body."
"Speaker AMY: You slept with him? 
Speaker PENNY: I didn't know what else to do.
He had those big, sad eyes. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh, sure, you had no choice. 
Speaker PENNY: He looked at me like this. 
Speaker AMY: ","Well, if that's all it takes, it's a good thing you don't have a dog."
"Speaker ROSS: I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. 
Speaker ROSS: ",Thank you.
"Speaker PHOEBE: You know whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two, cause on the thrid day my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","See now that I see crying over, but Bambi, is a cartoon."
"Speaker SCOTT: I am having a bit of trouble telling when people are sarcastic. 
Speaker MEMBER-BOY: ",Noooo. Really?

Speaker PERSON: Oh. Well then shut me up.

"Speaker PERSON: Come on! 
Speaker JOEY: ",Weā€™re not peeking?
"Speaker RAJ: You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard? 
Speaker PENNY: Why say it? Yes! 
Speaker RAJ: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list. 
Speaker PENNY: Well, good job. Now she hates me. 
Speaker RAJ: Great. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next."
"Speaker JOEY: The wheel or pick a Google card. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Let me think! Let me think! Oh, I don't care."
"Speaker JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. 
Speaker JOEY: ",It's that whole sensitive thing.
"Speaker SHELDON: It ended on a cliffhanger. 
Speaker LEONARD: They did. 
Speaker PENNY: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them? 
Speaker SHELDON: Dumplings?
Don't you understand what's going on here? 
Speaker PENNY: As a rule, no. 
Speaker SHELDON: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious.
Now I'll never know what happened. 
Speaker PENNY: Well, why don't you make up your own ending? 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."
"Speaker LEONARD: I am.
Are you interested in physics? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn't gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics.
Or ice dancing. 
Speaker LEONARD: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: That's amazing. 
Speaker SHELDON: Yes. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.
"Speaker JOEY: No! He blew us off! 
Speaker ROSS: What?! 
Speaker JOEY: I know! 
Speaker ROSS: ",I can't believe it.  Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
"Speaker RAJ: We did it. We have the west coast feed of hbo. 
Speaker HOWARD: Ooh,real sex. 
Speaker RAJ: Big deal. Every time I watch that show, it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers. 
Speaker LEONARD: All right,let's see what's on the east coast feed. 
Speaker RAJ: Dune. 
Speaker RAJ: ","Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
"Speaker SHELDON: or Leonard's gym membership. 
Speaker RAJ: We're not kicking him out. 
Stuart and I have become good friends. 
Speaker SHELDON: Okay, one vote for, one vote against.
Leonard, you're the tiebreaker. 
Speaker LEONARD: I don't have a problem with Stuart.
Besides, he gives us a 20% discount at his comic book store. 
Speaker SHELDON: Well, I don't sell my friendship that cheaply.

"Speaker AMY: The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, that's... that's what it is, so... 
Speaker AMY: You have such a good heart. 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah... I try. 
Speaker AMY: Come on. 
Speaker PENNY: Whoa, whoa, where are we going? 
Speaker AMY: We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment. 
Speaker PENNY: Well, what about Bernadette? 
Speaker AMY: ","Oh, screw her. She's just lucky we let her hang out with us."
"Speaker PENNY: You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair. 
I could do it for you. 
Speaker SHELDON: Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, 
Speaker SHELDON: here in town, we don't churn our own butter, we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde... 
Speaker LEONARD: Sheldon, be nice. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
"Speaker JOEY: I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.

Speaker PERSON: ",What do you think I was gonna do at home?
"Speaker LEONARD: Howard, what did you do? 
Speaker HOWARD: They're called tattoo sleeves. Look. 
Speaker HOWARD: I got them online. Raj got a set, too.

Speaker SHELDON: ","You know, I've always wanted to go to a Goth nightclub."
"Speaker MONICA: Umm, listen there's something I think you should know. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.

Speaker CHANDLER: Oh no no no, I just meant hypothetically 
Speaker MONICA: Ok , hypothetically, why won't I be married when I am forty? 
Speaker CHANDLER: No 
Speaker MONICA: No, what is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Dear god, this parachute is a knapsack"
"Speaker SHELDON: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note, it's 8:13 and we're still not playing Halo. 
Speaker LEONARD: Fine. We'll just play one-on-one until he gets back. 
Speaker SHELDON: One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one. 
Speaker SHELDON: We play teams, not one-on-one. 
Speaker SHELDON: One-on-one. 
Speaker LEONARD: The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half. 
Speaker RAJ: ","Sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from."
"Speaker CHANDLER: And this from cry for help department, are you wearing makeup? 
Speaker JOEY: Yes I am, as of today, I am official Joey Tribbiani actor slash model.

Speaker SHELDON: What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
"Speaker CHANDLER: I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? 
Speaker MONICA: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

"Speaker PERSON: So, what do you guys do? 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Oh, you know, Goth stuff. Goth magazines, Goth music."
"Speaker PERSON: Thank you, Leonard. That doesn't make it sound boring at all. 
Speaker AMY: So, how you holding up? 
Speaker PENNY: I'm fine. 
Speaker AMY: Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking. 
Speaker PERSON: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you're an actress. That must be pretty exciting.

Speaker PERSON: I see. And you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited? 
Speaker SHELDON: You said we were invited. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house."
"Speaker PERSON: It's Jake. 
Speaker JOEY: Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks? 
Speaker PERSON: Yeah, big fan. 
Speaker JOEY: ","Me too! There's a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?"
"Speaker RACHEL: We're not gonna do that. 
Speaker PERSON1: Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare. 
Speaker PERSON2: Am I interrupting? 
Speaker ROSS: ",Uh yes! Thank you.
"Speaker RACHEL: Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier... 
Speaker ROSS: No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed. 
Speaker RACHEL: I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me. 
Speaker ROSS: ",For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
"Speaker LEONARD: I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric. 
Speaker PERSON: If by ""eccentric"" you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",I think tonight was a very good start.
"Speaker HOWARD: but wait to be captured or killed. 
Speaker PERSON: That's the worst part, the waiting. 
Speaker HOWARD: All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your name on it. 
Speaker PERSON: The big wet ball of death. 
Speaker PERSON: ","Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Your tailor, is a very bad man. 
Speaker JOEY: Frankie what are you talking about? 
Speaker ROSS: Hey, whats going on? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Joey' trailer took advantage of me 
Speaker JOEY: No way, I have been going to the guy for twelve years 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh c'mon, he said he was gonna do my inseam, then he ran his hand, up my leg and then there was definite 
Speaker ROSS: What? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Cupping. 
Speaker JOEY: That's how they do pants. First they go up they move it over, then they go up the other side and move it back, then they do the rear. What? Ross will you tell them? Isn't that how a tailor measures ? 
Speaker ROSS: ",Yes yes it is! In Prison!!
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey Pheebs! 
Speaker PHOEBE: Ohh! You made up! 
Speaker MONICA: Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Joe? 
Speaker JOEY: Yeah! 
Speaker CHANDLER: Uh, you've had a lot of sex right? 
Speaker JOEY: ","When? Today? Some, not a lot."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Did I go to this school? 
Speaker ROSS: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Sure, nice. 
Speaker ROSS: Dude. You're married to my sister. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","You are right, by saying nice, I am virtually licking her."
"Speaker LEONARD: And shake twice for Texas. 
Speaker LEONARD: Something his mother taught him. 
Speaker SHELDON: All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection. 
Speaker PERSON: ","That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first."
"Speaker ROSS: No, come on don't start. Ouch! 
Speaker PERSON: What? 
Speaker ROSS: Stupid balls are in the way. 
Speaker ROSS: ",Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
"Speaker SCOTT: I finally got to admit it to myself. I have got a sarcasm problem. 
Speaker MODERATOR: ",Well scott I am sure we are all really really looking forward to hear your story.
"Speaker DOROTHY: We thought you might like to join us for dinner? 
Speaker SOPHIA: I get the feeling Dorothy that you might be a little mad at me. Why is that? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","How about stopping by new years eve with three naked women, throwing up in the pool, passing out in the punch bowl, and relieving yourself in the linen closet?"
"Speaker ROSS: I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou. 
Speaker MONICA: Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents. 
Speaker ROSS: ",Yeah. What-what should I do?
"Speaker PERSON: I am not divorced yet. Chandler, you know you just invited me over here for pasta and all of a sudden you are talking about moving in together. I wasn't even that hungry. Its getting really late and I should just umm. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Oh no donÕt go. I have scared you. I have said too much. I am hopeless and awkward and desperate for love.
"Speaker AMY: That bitch is crafty. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: You think? 
Speaker AMY: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Well, what makes me the weakest member? 
Speaker AMY: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
"Speaker BLANCHE: They are ain't here yet 
Speaker DOROTHY: No, but they should be any minute 
Speaker ROSE: You seem a little nervous. 
Speaker DOROTHY: Oh you're sure I am 
Speaker ROSE: Are you nervous cause you haven't met Michael's fiancee? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","No Rose, I am nervous because Sonny Bono gets elected mayor of Palm Springs, he is gonna make all the postmens wear leather bell bottoms and a fur vest."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hold on, there is something different. 
Speaker ROSS: I went to their tanning place your wife suggested. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Was that place the sun?
"Speaker MONICA: So, um, will you bring the truck? 
Speaker PERSON: I'll even let you ring the bell. 
Speaker RACHEL: Oh, my god. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ","See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
"Speaker HOWARD: Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist. 
Speaker RAJ: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist? 
Speaker HOWARD: Former dentist.
I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been. 
Speaker RAJ: So you're wandering all around by yourself?
That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","It's okay, you know, we space cowboys don't do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels."
"Speaker SHELDON: This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails. 
Speaker LEONARD: What do you got? 
Speaker SHELDON: I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. 
Speaker SHELDON: Behold. 
Speaker LEONARD: ""Magnets: What Do They Stick To?"" If the answer is ""metal,"" it's not exactly groundbreaking. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","The original title was ""A Rederivation of Maxwell's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism"""" I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch."
"Speaker PERSON: That's funny. Who are they? 
Speaker ROSS: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend. 
Speaker PERSON: You mean they're lovers. 
Speaker ROSS: ",If you wanna put a label on it.
"Speaker CHANDLER: I know Richard's really nice and everything, it's just that we don't know him really well you know, plus he is old  ...  er than some people. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",But younger than some buildings!
"Speaker RACHEL: Do you guys have any exta ribbon? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh yeah sure, what do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, rafia, gingam , felt. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",And I think my testicles may be in here too
"Speaker JOEY: Hey, Chan. Can you help me out here, I promise I'll pay you back. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh yeah ok, including the waffles last week, you now owe me, seventeen zillion dollars."
"Speaker PERSON: Well, I'm sure that, uh, you...
have a lot of questions. 
Speaker SHELDON: Who was he? 
Speaker PERSON: His name is Ron.
I met him at my prayer group. 
Speaker SHELDON: How long have you been involved with him? 
Speaker PERSON: A few months. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
"Speaker PHOEBE: And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
"Speaker PENNY: That was a really nice dinner. 
Speaker PENNY: I'm glad you asked me out again. 
Speaker LEONARD: Me, too; I missed you. 
Speaker PENNY: You see me all the time. 
Speaker PENNY: You sure you just don't miss the sex? 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?"
"Speaker SHELDON: it's-it's what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do. 
Speaker SHELDON: He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn't want to, which was look at my stupid face. 
Speaker LEONARD: That's a rude thing to say. Out loud. 
Speaker SHELDON: It's an outrage.
Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","You know, if you're really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
"Speaker PERSON: I am sorry, why did Phoebe and Mike breakup? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Because his penis was too big. I am sorry, thatÕs the kind of thing I do."
"Speaker RAJ: Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas. 
Speaker HOWARD: Eat another pie, you'll have your own bazongas. 
Speaker RAJ: That's cruel. 
Speaker RAJ: You know it goes straight to my hips. 
Speaker SHELDON: Gentlemen, please focus. 
Speaker SHELDON: You're facing a fire-breathing dragon. 
Speaker RAJ: I don't know if I want to play anymore. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons & Dragons, this game's in serious trouble."
"Speaker JOEY: Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. 
Speaker CHANDLER: If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference? 
Speaker MONICA: Rach? What are you doing? 
Speaker RACHEL: ","Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey 
Speaker JOEY: You son of a bitch! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Is it me or the greetings gone downhill around here?
"Speaker SHELDON: I don't believe it matters what the topic is. 
Speaker SHELDON: What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. 
It's all about the execution. 
Speaker LEONARD: Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. 
Speaker LEONARD: Uh, new salon topic.
What's more important, an idea or its execution? 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Oh, that's fun. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey Ross I was wondering. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh my god, where are all the men?"
"Speaker RACHEL: You guys can pee standing up. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",We can? Ok I am trying that.
"Speaker PERSON1: (chimes) Wisten to me.
Not westauwant; westauwant. 
Speaker PERSON2: (chimes) I don't know what you mean by ""not westauwant; westauwant."" 
Speaker PERSON1: See? Total cwap.
You suck, Siwi. 
Speaker RAJ: Hey, don't talk to her like that. 
She's a lady. 
Speaker PERSON1: ","Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist."
"Speaker HOWARD: That's very nice of you, but I made other plans. 
Speaker SHELDON: Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready. 
Speaker PERSON: Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon. 
Speaker SHELDON: Hello. Hey. 
Speaker RAJ: Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands. 
Speaker PERSON: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together. 
Speaker RAJ: ","Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex."
"Speaker RAJ: Buzz Lightyear is not real. 
Speaker HOWARD: No, that's not what I'm talking about. 
Speaker RAJ: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real? 
Speaker HOWARD: No 
Speaker RAJ: Okay, um... how about ""Crash""? 
Howard ""Crash"" Wolowitz. 
Speaker HOWARD: ","Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named ""Crash."""
"Speaker PERSON1: Baby, you're not that kind 
Speaker PERSON1: Don't go breaking my heart 
Speaker PERSON2: Anybody do ""Walking on Sunshine"" yet? 
Speaker SHELDON: No 
Speaker PERSON2: Dibs. 
Speaker PERSON3: ","I'm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?"
"Speaker JOEY: Oh no no, that's the beauty of it, it goes with everything. You put this on, you are good to go! 
Speaker CHANDLER: Hell I have never been good to go, so, what the hell why not try some jewellery huh? 
Speaker JOEY: Oh man! You are so wearing that bracelet! 
Speaker CHANDLER: I so am 
Speaker JOEY: You have any idea what this will do to your sex life? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Well, it will probably slow me down at first. But once I am used to the extra weight, I ll get back on track."
"Speaker AMY: ""And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, ""and Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte."" 
Speaker PENNY: What the hell was that? 
Speaker AMY: ","Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. ""The Miller's Tale"" by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks."
"Speaker RACHEL: All right, I'm outta here! 
Speaker MONICA: I'm kidding! I'm kidding! 
Speaker RACHEL: So were done then! 
Speaker PERSON: ","Almost! But first, we gotta start."
"Speaker RACHEL: Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain! 
Speaker JOEY: Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's! 
Speaker RACHEL: Really? 
Speaker JOEY: ",Yeah! Look!
"Speaker MONICA: Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break? 
Speaker MONICA: My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
"Speaker PERSON: Leonard. Come, join us. 
Speaker LEONARD: Hey, Dave.
And Penny, what a surprise. 
Speaker PENNY: Dave was just showing me around the university. This place is unbelievable! 
Speaker LEONARD: I know, I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga. 
Speaker LEONARD: ","- Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like ""yoga."""
"Speaker DOROTHY: No rose. 
Speaker ROSE: Are you upset because Blanche is going to sell the house and we can't live together. 
Speaker DOROTHY: ",No I am upset because Joe Piscapo didn't get the lead role in rain man.
"Speaker PHOEBE: We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. 
Speaker MONICA: Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly. 
Speaker PHOEBE: All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"" 
Speaker MONICA: ",And did he?
"Speaker ROSS: Ok it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat at the door so she had to pass by me if she like to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Were you so late because you were burying this woman?
"Speaker RAJ: This man became my whole world. 
Speaker PERSON: Yeah, nice speech, Francine. 
Speaker RAJ: I'm not done, but thank you. 
Speaker RAJ: I think back.... 
Speaker RAJ: ","...to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
"Speaker HOWARD: Are you saying that you've been holding back? 
Speaker LEONARD: Of course. Out of respect. 
Speaker HOWARD: So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny? 
Speaker RAJ: Who were you respecting then? 
Speaker LEONARD: Well, I've dated plenty of women. 
Speaker LEONARD: There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary. The word ""plenty"" has been redefined to mean ""two."""
"Speaker RACHEL: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee. 
Speaker MONICA: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close. 
Speaker RACHEL: Closer than here? 
Speaker PHOEBE: ","Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. 
Speaker PERSON: ","Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
"Speaker SHELDON: It's probably a euphemism for urination. 
Speaker PENNY: Sheldon, what is wrong with you? 
Speaker SHELDON: Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. 
Speaker SHELDON: I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside. 
Speaker PENNY: Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Oh, I see why you're confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you're forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That's all about yucky, squishy things."
"Speaker PERSON: Wow, this place is awesome. 
Speaker PERSON: Where do they keep the Archies? 
Speaker SHELDON: ","In the bedrooms of ten-year- old girls, where they belong."
"Speaker LEONARD: Okay. On the count of three, I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. 
Speaker LEONARD: Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. 
Speaker LEONARD: Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
"Speaker DOROTHY: Now PERSON is depressed Rose. 
Speaker ROSE: Do you think she is depressed about Rebecca 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","No Rose, she is depressed because Marvel had manners on only once a week"
"Speaker RACHEL: Ahh! 
Speaker PERSON: It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun. 
Speaker RACHEL: A scooter! 
Speaker ROSS: ",Stick to the list.
"Speaker PERSON1: Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings. 
Speaker PERSON2: Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour. 
Speaker MONICA: Oh my God! Oh my God! 
Speaker PERSON1: ","Ah well, this is the living room."
"Speaker HOWARD: Thank you. 
Speaker HOWARD: So, shall we get started? 
Speaker PERSON: Sure.
But can I ask you a question first? 
Speaker HOWARD: Do you want to play Cylon and colonist? 
Speaker PERSON: I want to know why you're playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight. 
Speaker HOWARD: You mean, Bernadette? 
Speaker PERSON: ","No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She's a wonderful girl and she really likes you."
"Speaker DOROTHY: Oh fine we will! 
Speaker SOPHIA: Is that Paolo? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","Oh ma no, it was a little girl selling girl scout toilets."
"Speaker HOWARD: A gallant man would defend his fiance for being called a urethra. 
Speaker LEONARD: Can we please change the subject? 
Speaker RAJ: Well, that didn't go your way. 
Speaker PENNY: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here? 
Speaker PERSON: Uh, well, actually I came to see you. 
Speaker PENNY: Really? Why? 
Speaker LEONARD: ","Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights. 
Speaker RACHEL: Oh shoot! I work Monday nights. 
Speaker PHOEBE: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some? 
Speaker JOEY: ","When they're hungry enough, they'll come in."
"Speaker SHELDON: (thermometer beeps) 102.2.
(coughs) 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It's like you're not even trying to get better.
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. 
Speaker JOEY: Hello. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm"
"Speaker PHOEBE: I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler. 
Speaker ROSS: Oh my God! Of course, of course. 
Speaker ROSS: ","Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"
"Speaker PERSON: What are you seeing? 
Speaker BLANCHE: Nightmare on Elm Street 4 
Speaker ROSE: Do you have to see 1, 2 and 3 to appreciate it? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","No Rose, it stands alone."
"Speaker BERNADETTE: Should I give him another chance? 
Speaker LEONARD: It's up to you. He didn't call your experiment stupid. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: Come here, tushy face. 
Speaker LEONARD: ""Tushy face. "" Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: ","Raj, you should've seen Leonard's experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
"Speaker RAJ: It's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine's Day can come here tonight and be together. 
Speaker PERSON: ","Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here."
"Speaker MONICA: And the boots don't really go with it. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","You said you spent all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses and pants. What do you plan on wearing? A Chicken suit?"
"Speaker SHELDON: And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter.
unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones. 
Speaker LEONARD: So I guess it's a good thing we stopped for dinner. 
Speaker RAJ: You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love  teaches us 
Speaker HOWARD: Oh, shut up. 
Speaker AMY: ","...so anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix."
"Speaker RAJ: It's true-- you're both gorgeous. 
Speaker RAJ: Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. 
Speaker RAJ: You get why I've been alone most of my adult life. 
Speaker PERSON: So, what brings you by? Well, 
Speaker HOWARD: ",I don't need a reason-- it's my house.
"Speaker PHOEBE: No, no! 
Speaker MONICA: Give it to me! 
Speaker PHOEBE: You can't have it. 
Speaker MONICA: Give it to me! 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",No
"Speaker JOEY: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Y'know who has a great video camera? 
Speaker PHOEBE: Greg and Jenny? 
Speaker MONICA: ",Do you still wanna call  'em? I wanna call  'em.
"Speaker PERSON: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! 
Speaker PERSON: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. 
Speaker RACHEL: Okay. 
Speaker PERSON: ",When are you coming home?
"Speaker RACHEL: Uh-huh. 
Speaker PHOEBE: That sounds great! 
Speaker JOEY: Hey! 
Speaker MONICA: ","Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
"Speaker ROSS: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more. 
Speaker RACHEL: ",What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?
"Speaker RAJ: That's a great idea. I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well. 
Speaker SHELDON: What is it about the word ""unique"" you don't understand? 
Speaker HOWARD: Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut. 
Speaker RAJ: Well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision. 
Speaker SHELDON: There's Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",Why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
"Speaker SHELDON: There it is again.
Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, well, I'm sorry for your loss.
- Oh! - Good night, sir. 
Speaker SHELDON: Unbelievable.
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he's a high-profile asset to the university. 
Speaker LEONARD: Well, he's not wrong.
Howard did go to the International Space Station. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"
"Speaker MONICA: I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Yes, we all know how cruel a parent can be, about the flatness of a child's pillow."
"Speaker LEONARD: I honestly don't care. 
Speaker RAJ: Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions. 
Speaker LEONARD: What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass. 
Speaker HOWARD: Would that be a giant rat's ass? 
Speaker SHELDON: For the record, giant rats are possible. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
"Speaker ROSS: I don't want to be single. I just, I just want to be married again. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",And I just won a million dollars!
"Speaker SHELDON: Yes. 
Speaker PERSON: And some people in the science community are calling it ""The Wonder Blunder."" 
Speaker SHELDON: Who? Give me their names.
I bet it's Wolowitz. 
Speaker PERSON: It's just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. 
Speaker PERSON: It's like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
"Speaker CHANDLER: Have you seen Joey? 
Speaker MONICA: What's the matter? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Oh, just this!  Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we 
Speaker JOEY: ","Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."
"Speaker MONICA: You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game. 
Speaker RACHEL: Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men. 
Speaker MONICA: Pete, can I get you something else? 
Speaker PERSON: ","Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given'  'em out."
"Speaker LEONARD: How do I look? 
Speaker SHELDON: Could you be more specific? 
Speaker LEONARD: Can you tell I'm perspiring a little? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.
"Speaker CHANDLER: No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name! 
Speaker JOEY: It's not that bad. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. 
Speaker JOEY: ","So, you're just Bing?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",That monkey has got a Ross on its ass!
"Speaker SHELDON: Ask me why. 
Speaker LEONARD: Do I have to? 
Speaker SHELDON: Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward. 
Speaker LEONARD: Why? 
Speaker SHELDON: The learning opportunities would be abundant. 
Speaker SHELDON: Additionally, I like having my belly scratched. 
Speaker PENNY: ",I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
"Speaker ROSS: Chandler. I sensed it was you. 
Speaker CHANDLER: What?! 
Speaker ROSS: Unagi. I'm always aware. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"

Speaker PENNY: ","Oh, my God, that's where I know you from."
"Speaker RACHEL: Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.

Speaker PERSON: Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine. 
Speaker SHELDON: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. 
Speaker SHELDON: Can I make an appointment for you to look at them? 
Speaker PERSON: Um... okay, I guess. 
Speaker AMY: ","I'm with him three years, nothing. She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off."
"Speaker MONICA: I am so sorry, please stop freaking out. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","I am not freaking out, why would I be freaking out? A woman named Hildy called and said we will get married, but that happens everyday"
"Speaker PERSON: Sophia was discharged, is she here? 
Speaker DOROTHY: ","No, I haven't taken her out of the trunk of the car yet."
"Speaker PENNY: Awkward silence. Sheldon on his phone.
No touching. Somebody's having date night. 
Speaker AMY: It's actually steamier than it looks.
Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings. 
Speaker SHELDON: Oh, no, I got bored with that.
I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.

Speaker PERSON1: You were saying? 
Speaker PERSON2: Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don't expect me to do it for you. 
Speaker RAJ: End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you. 
Speaker HOWARD: Happy birthday to you. 
Speaker PERSON1: Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas you can actually get married in."
"Speaker JOEY: Uhh, the ball thing. 
Speaker ROSS: Yeah? 
Speaker JOEY: Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?! 
Speaker ROSS: ",Yeah it would!
"Speaker JOEY: But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, 
Speaker JOEY: ",I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
"Speaker AMY: Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise. 
Speaker SHELDON: Cluck-cluck-cluck. 
Speaker AMY: Sheldon, look at me.
I think it's time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group.
Where he goes, the group goes. 
Speaker SHELDON: Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. 
Speaker SHELDON: I'm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time. 
Speaker AMY: ",I'm not saying that you're not fun. You're the most fun person I know.
"Speaker ROSS: When did I say you were boring?!

Speaker PERSON: We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. 
You want anything? 
Speaker LEONARD: I'm fine.

"Speaker HOWARD: Do you really think you should be drinking right now? 
Speaker RAJ: How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady? 
Speaker HOWARD: I don't know. Seek professional help? 
Speaker RAJ: ",I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
"Speaker PHOEBE: Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer,fireman, can-can I help you? 
Speaker PERSON: We found your fire alarm in the trash chute. That's not mine. 
Speaker PERSON: ",Yes it is.
"Speaker SHELDON: Leonard, this is Tom. 
Speaker LEONARD: Hi, Tom. Sheldon? 
Speaker LEONARD: Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria? 
Speaker SHELDON: ",You were very clear. As was everyone else at the table.
"Speaker ROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. 
Speaker CHANDLER: So, let's go. 
Speaker ROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
"Speaker JOEY: That's the rule. 
Speaker CHANDLER: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! 
Speaker JOEY: How'd you get to that? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
"Speaker SHELDON: Oh, oh, oh. 
Speaker SHELDON: Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair? 
Speaker LEONARD: No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister. 
Speaker PENNY: All right, well, what do you think he wants? 
Speaker LEONARD: I don't know. 
Speaker SHELDON: You know, the holidays are just around the corner. 
Speaker SHELDON: Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there. 
Speaker LEONARD: I told you. That was a different guy. 
Speaker PENNY: ",Hmm. That's too bad. We could have spent New Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
"Speaker RACHEL: Oh! 
Speaker MONICA: Oh God 
Speaker PHOEBE: Now you know how you really feel about it. 
Speaker RACHEL: ","Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!"

Speaker JOEY: ","Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all."
"Speaker CHANDLER: Get up 
Speaker JOEY: What? 
Speaker CHANDLER: You're in my seat 
Speaker JOEY: How is it your seat? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Cause I was sitting there 
Speaker JOEY: But then you left 
Speaker CHANDLER: But its not like I went to Spain, I went to the bathroom , you knew I was coming back. 
Speaker JOEY: Whats the big deal? 
Speaker CHANDLER: The big deal is that I was sitting there last, so.. that's my seat 
Speaker JOEY: Actually, the last place you were sitting was in there 
Speaker ROSS: You guys, you know what? it doesn't matter. Because you both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops! 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","I just have to do one thing, really quickly, its not a big thing  ...  GET UP||"
"Speaker ROSS: According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejesus out of him?

Speaker CHANDLER: ",His legs flail about as if independent from his body
"Speaker CHANDLER: Hey 
Speaker MONICA: So how was Joan? 
Speaker CHANDLER: Broke up with her 
Speaker MONICA: Why 
Speaker ROSS: Don't tell me, because of the big nostril thing?

"Speaker MONICA: How was your date with Ginger. 
Speaker CHANDLER: Great. It was great. She is , uh, she is great, great looking, great personality, she is greatness 
Speaker MONICA: ",Sounds like she has got the whole package!
"Speaker HOWARD: Why not ""World's Greatest Engineer""? 
Speaker SHELDON: I'm sorry.
I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn't press enter. Now down to business. 
Speaker SHELDON: What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company 
Speaker SHELDON: Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard. 
Speaker HOWARD: We're not quitting on Leonard. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",I understand. Your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
"Speaker JOEY: Well the tough thing is she really wants to have sex with me. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",Crazy bitch!
"Speaker ROSS: Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later. Yeah? 
Speaker JOEY: Really? No one's home? 
Speaker ROSS: ",I don't think so. Hello?  When you get in there
"Speaker PHOEBE: I know, I opened it up and it  and there it was just floathing in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker. 
Speaker CHANDLER: ","Maybe it's a contest, you know? Like ""Collect all five""."
"Speaker SHELDON: They're here. 
Speaker LEONARD: Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet. 
Speaker LEONARD: What are you doing? 
Speaker SHELDON: I'm checking for musical instruments. 
Speaker SHELDON: Does that sound like castanets to you? 
Speaker LEONARD: The box says ""kitchen."" 
Speaker SHELDON: ","So? Do cocaine smugglers write ""cocaine"" on the box?"
"Speaker SHELDON: Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks. 
Speaker LEONARD: You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard. 
Speaker PERSON: Not really, no. 
Speaker PERSON: It's funny, huh, Leonard? 
Speaker PERSON: Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser.
And now we're reversed. 
Speaker PERSON: You're the winner. 
Speaker SHELDON: ",You'd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
"Speaker PERSON: So, we're all standing around looking at the post-op X ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...one of my earrings. 
Speaker LEONARD: Oh, my God, what did you do? 
Speaker PERSON: ","What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!"

Speaker CHANDLER: ","Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense"
"Speaker SHELDON: My new computer came with Windows 7. 
Speaker SHELDON: Windows 7 is much more use r- friendly than Windows Vista. 
Speaker SHELDON: I don't like that. 
Speaker LEONARD: ",Don't you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
"Speaker RACHEL: It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard. 
Speaker ROSS: Yeah I know. 
Speaker ROSS: ","On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with."

Speaker CHANDLER: ",If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
"Speaker SHELDON: What do you think? 
Speaker AMY: Can I speak to you for a second? 
Speaker SHELDON: I'll be right back. 
Speaker SHELDON: Feel free to play with yourself. 
Speaker AMY: I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. 
Speaker AMY: You need to ask him to leave. 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."
"Speaker RACHEL: Okay. Let's use this brush. 
Speaker ROSS: Okay. This stuff? 
Speaker RACHEL: Yeah.

"Speaker HOWARD: You're kidding. You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps. That's the estrogen hat trick. 
Speaker SHELDON: What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. 
Speaker SHELDON: It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan. 
Speaker RAJ: ","If you don't like this stuff, let's go next door and build her a bear."
"Speaker SHELDON: My tongue won't go as far forward as it used to. 
Speaker LEONARD: Maybe your tongue is shrinking.

Speaker LEONARD: Since when do you take after-dinner walks? 
Speaker HOWARD: Yeah, since when do you take walks?

"Speaker RACHEL: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. 
Speaker JOEY: I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson. 
Speaker MONICA: Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it. 
Speaker RACHEL: ","That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed."
"Speaker PERSON: Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable. 
Speaker RACHEL: I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. 
Speaker RACHEL: ",You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.

Speaker PERSON: I thought you didn't smoke. 
Speaker RACHEL: Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? 
Speaker RACHEL: ","Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?"
"Speaker CHANDLER: Still upset because I saw her boobies. 
Speaker ROSS: Well what? What were you doing seeing her boobies? 
Speaker CHANDLER: ",It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
"Speaker PERSON: This will be your phone. 
Speaker JOEY: That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls. 
Speaker PERSON: No you answer it and take pledges. 
Speaker JOEY: ",But I'm the host!
"Speaker RACHEL: Pheebs, that's great!

Speaker RACHEL: But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle. 
Speaker PHOEBE: ",I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
"Speaker SHELDON: Why not? It seems like you're improvising your entire curriculum. 
Speaker PENNY: This is all about listening and responding. 
Speaker SHELDON: Gotcha. 
Speaker PENNY: I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it. 
Speaker SHELDON: All right. 
Speaker PENNY: All right. 
Speaker SHELDON: Action. 
Speaker PENNY: Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls ""action."" 
Speaker SHELDON: ","Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"
"Speaker PERSON: Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? 
Speaker PERSON: As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles. 
Speaker BERNADETTE: So, where is it? 
Speaker PERSON: ","I don't know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?"
"Speaker LEONARD: Do you really want him to write back? 
Speaker SHELDON: Yeah, I do. No matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying, ""Oh, really?"" 
Speaker LEONARD: Me-wow. 
Speaker RAJ: ","I've, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper."
"Speaker PENNY: Damn. 
Speaker AMY: Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. 
Speaker AMY: And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb. 
Speaker PENNY: ","Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."
"Speaker PERSON: That's what I love about science-- there's no one right answer. 
Speaker LEONARD: So...you and Zack again, huh? 
Speaker PENNY: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again. 
Speaker PERSON: Were we here earlier? 
Speaker PENNY: Okay, we should, we should go. 
Speaker PERSON: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.

Speaker DOROTHY: ","No Rose, at a pie eating contest."
"Speaker HOWARD: Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me? 
Speaker PENNY: Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it. 
Speaker HOWARD: ",I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
"Speaker PERSON: Rajesh!
You up?
You ready for breakfast? 
Speaker RAJ: Oh, boy. Breakfast. 
Speaker HOWARD: Okay, Raj, listen to me.
